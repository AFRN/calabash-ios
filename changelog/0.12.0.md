## 0.12.0 changelog

Primarily a bugfix, polish and stability release.

### Features

* Fast `enter_text` command (https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/pull/639)
This skips using the software keyboard and calls `setValue`. This is sometimes desired for speed, 
but has the downside that apps reacting to individual keystrokes (e.g. typeahead) don't respond normally.
Example: https://github.com/calabash/x-platform-example/blob/master/features/ios/pages/login_page.rb#L23 


* Generalize indexpath search to collection views. This will support queries of form:

`touch("collectionViewCell indexPath:#{row},#{sec}")`

https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/607
https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/99


* Dump views https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/102
To see a view dump, use: `curl http://localhost:37265/dump`

* Read Server port from app's Info.plist https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/94 @isachs

### Changes

* Reduce logging and allow `server\_debug\_level()` to control the debug level on the server.

* Experimental new strategy for communicating with UIAutomation (:shared_element, Shared UIA Element)
https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios-server/pull/97
Note that while this works well, there are still some cases where it breaks down, e.g., app deeplinking.
(https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/642)

* Detect architecture of `.app` bundles to prevent "App launches and quits repeatedly"
https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/Hot-Topics#1-when-targeting-a-simulator-the-app-launches-then-quits-several-times-in-rapid-succession


### Fixes

- App hanging when UIAutomation is active and the app logs too much via NSLog (We removed excessive logging in Calabash server, 
but this can still occur if the app logs itself).
- Missed writes to preferences while automating
- Intermittent 'Could not parse response '';' error... https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/600
- Intermittent timeouts performing gestures... https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/585
- Backslash handling in 0.11.5.pre5 is inconsistent... https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/640
- iOS8 swipe with query fails https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/586
- Unstable accept of System alerts https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/636

#### Other

We've discovered a known issue when running on arm64 devices on iOS 7.0.x: reflective extraction of values of type double always 
return null due to a bug in iOS. For example `query("view", :alpha).first`.
