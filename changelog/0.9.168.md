## 0.9.168 changelog

**IMPORTANT** requires a server update to 0.9.167

### Features

##### support for iPhone apps emulated on iPad in iOS 7

When testing an iPhone app on an iPad, the app must be scaled to 1x in order for calabash to translated touch coordinates correctly.  To ensure your app is displayed at 1x, change your `Before` hook to look like this:

```
# support/01_launch.rb
Before do |scenario|
  @calabash_launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
  unless @calabash_launcher.calabash_no_launch?
    @calabash_launcher.relaunch
    @calabash_launcher.calabash_notify(self)
    
    # ensures that emulated iphone apps are at 1x
    # this is a nop if the device is not an ipad
    ensure_ipad_emulation_1x
  end
...
end
```


### Fixes

- (issues https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/185) - touch offset is incorrect for iphone app running on iOS 7 ipad simulator because app is always shown at 2x


### Deprecated

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text`
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.
