## 0.9.169 changelog

**IMPORTANT** requires a server update to 0.9.169 https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/B1-Updating-your-Calabash-iOS-version#2-update-the-calabashframework

**IMPORTANT** recommend an update to hooks

### before 0.9.169 release

in order of priority 

***@required***

- [x] must change the docs re:  01_launch - hooks are not overwritten on the XTC
- [x] needs fix for accessibility window
- [x] simulator_helper needs method deprecation and refactor
   - [x] needs changelog 
   - [ ] wiki documentation about change to launch hooks
- [x] calabash-ios-sim `calabash_sim_reset` is broken
- [x] changelog needs blurb about Karl's additions
   - Experimental support for navigating the accessibility view hierarchy
   - support for direct query by class. Instead of view:'MyView' just MyView. Similarly some prefer UITableViewCell to tableViewCell
- [x] Rakefile rspec breaks briar build algorithm...might cause problems for others
   - briar now includes rspec as dependency...not ideal, but hey, what can you do?


***@optional***

- [ ] update motion gem
- [ ] instruments cannot launch app if Instruments.app is open (add to run_loop)
- [ ] [XTC gem should update rubyzip](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/288)
- [ ] update README.md to show frank 'support' as 0.11.0
- [ ] touching iOS level alerts (needs villar's alert tests)
- [ ] resolve app bundle path problems by finding the *most* recent -cal.app target
- [ ] resurrect the slider ruby API
- [ ] make disabling pre-defined steps easier
- [ ] IAP

### Features

#### Querying by class name 

Previously all class name queries without `view:` were subject to a 'convenient' rewrite: prepend `UI` 
and capitalize. For example, `label` becomes `UILabel`. This was confusing to many who expected a class name
would match all objects of (sub-)type that class. For that reason the following is now implemented:

1. If the class-name query begins with a lower-case letter, do the re-write. So `label` is still `UILabel`.
2. If the class-name query begins with a capital letter, do not perform the re-write.

This makes it possible to query a class just by typing its name, e.g.,

```ruby
    query("UILabel parent UITableViewCell first")
    
    [0] {
               "text" => "Cell 0",
               "rect" => {
            "center_x" => 160,
                   "y" => 0,
               "width" => 320,
                   "x" => 0,
            "center_y" => 22,
              "height" => 44
        },
        ...
    }
```

#### text property available in default query output

See example query above.

#### Alpha support for navigating the accessibility view hierarchy

By default, Calabash queries will search through the parent/sub-view hierarchy of UIKit.

This release adds alpha support for the hierarchy defined by the iOS accessibility protocols (`UIAccessibility*`).

Specifically it is possible to modify the direction of the query via modifiers `acc` and `accParent`.

This is sometimes needed and sometimes more intuitive (even if not strictly needed). It can also lead to more robust queries in some cases.

A classical example would be iOS tab bar:

    irb(main):022:0> classes("UITabBar child *")
    [
        [0] "UITabBarButton",
        [1] "UITabBarButton",
        [2] "UITabBarButton",
        [3] "UITabBarButton",
        [4] "UIImageView"
    ]
    irb(main):023:0> query("UITabBar child button")
    [] #What? confusing! But on iOS, a UITabBarButton is not a subclass of UIButton
    # acc to the rescue
    irb(main):024:0> query("acc UITabBar button")
    [
        [0] {
                  "class" => "UITabBarButton",
                     "id" => nil,
                   "rect" => {
                "center_x" => 40,
                       "y" => 520,
                   "width" => 76,
                       "x" => 2,
                "center_y" => 544,
                  "height" => 48
            },
    ...
    ]
    
Another example would be non-UIKit components advertising themselves via UIAccessibility.
    


#### Calabash Server and Calabash Gem Compatibility Checks

If you server version is not compatible with your gem version, calabash will warn you at launch.

```
WARN: server version is not compatible with gem version
please update your server and gem
server version: '0.9.168'
   gem version: '0.9.169'
```

You can now do a visual check to see what version of the server you have installed.

```
$ ls -1 calabash.framework/Versions/
0.9.169  <== server version
A
Current
```

And you can do a programmatic check as well.

```
$ calabash.framework/Resources/version => 0.9.169
```

#### EXPERIMENTAL: Synchronous operation combining waiting, waiting for animations and tapping.

Feedback is wanted on this. 


### Changes
#### at\_exit launch hooks

The `Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper` module has been deprecated.

Please replace:

```
Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper.stop
```

with this:

```
launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
launcher.simulator_launcher.stop
```

The most common place to find the deprecated call is in your `support/01_launch.rb` file.

###### OLD

```
at_exit do
  launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
  if launcher.simulator_target?
    Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper.stop unless launcher.calabash_no_stop?
  end
end
```

###### NEW

```
at_exit do
  launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
  if launcher.simulator_target?
    launcher.simulator_launcher.stop unless launcher.calabash_no_stop?
  end
end
```
