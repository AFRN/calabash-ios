## 0.9.169 changelog

**IMPORTANT** requires a server update to 0.9.169

### Features

### Fixes

- (issues https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/278) - the output of simulator_helper `self.derived_data_dir_for_project` should be more tightly controlled with `CALABASH_FULL_CONSOLE_OUTPUT`

- Non-obvious behaviour for some query strings with whitespace scattred, e.g., query("* text:'View 1'"), query("* text    :     'View 1'    "), query("* text:   'View 1'    ") are now all the same (previously the whitespace changed the parsing).


### Deprecated

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text`
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.
* since 0.9.168 `iphone_5?` and `Device::iphone_5?` - use `iphone_4in?`
* since 0.9.168 `OS` environmental variable has been deprecated - use `DEVICE_TARGET` instead
* since 0.9.168 `SDK_VERSION` environment variable has been deprecated - use `DEVICE_TARGET`
