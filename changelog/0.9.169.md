### Changes

#### at\_exit launch hooks

The `Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper` module has been deprecated.

Please replace:

```
Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper.stop
```

with this:

```
launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
launcher.simulator_launcher.stop
```

The most common place to find the deprecated call is in your `support/01_launch.rb` file.

###### OLD

```
at_exit do
  launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
  if launcher.simulator_target?
    Calabash::Cucumber::SimulatorHelper.stop unless launcher.calabash_no_stop?
  end
end
```

###### NEW

```
at_exit do
  launcher = Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.new
  if launcher.simulator_target?
    launcher.simulator_launcher.stop unless launcher.calabash_no_stop?
  end
end
```

### Features


#### Calabash Server and Calabash Gem Compatibility Checks

If you server version is not compatible with your gem version, calabash will warn you at launch.

```
WARN: server version is not compatible with gem version
please update your server and gem
server version: '0.9.168'
   gem version: '0.9.169'
```

You can now do a visual check to see what version of the server you have installed.

```
$ ls -1 calabash.framework/Versions/
0.9.169  <== server version
A
Current
```

And you can do a programmatic check as well.

```
$ calabash.framework/Resources/version => 0.9.169
```
