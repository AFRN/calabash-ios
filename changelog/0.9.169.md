### Fixes

### Deprecated *** NEW ***

These functions, methods, or cucumber steps have been deprecated and will now generate warning messages.

To suppress deprecated warnings set `ENV['CALABASH_NO_DEPRECATION']=1` (not recommend).

* since 0.9.131 `query_all` - use `query("view all")` - see [Query Syntax](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/wiki/05-Query-syntax)
* since 0.9.145 `set_text`  - use `keyboard_enter_text` or (sparingly) `clear_text`
* since 0.9.151 `When I clear "some text field"` - no replacement
* since 0.9.163 `await_keyboard` - use `wait_for_keyboard`
* since 0.9.163 `keyboard_enter_char` second arg `should_screenshot` has been replaced by an options hash. Use the `:should_screenshot` key instead
* since 0.9.163 `send_uia_command`  - use `uia("...javascript..", options)` instead.  This has not been formally deprecated (no warnings will be generated) yet, but it will be in a future version.
* since 0.9.168 `iphone_5?` and `Device::iphone_5?` - use `iphone_4in?`
* since 0.9.169 the 'screenshot2' route has been deprecated (removed) - use the screenshot route instead
