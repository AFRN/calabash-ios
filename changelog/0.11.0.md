## 0.11.0 Change log

This is a bug-fix release targeting primarily Xcode 6, iOS 8 and the new iOS devices. It adds no new features. 

### Fixes

- Fix running device with `DEVICE_TARGET=device` https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/534
-  `touch` fails silently in landscape orientation in xcode 6: https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/528

- Support for serialization of new type encodings introduced in iOS8 (ome queries return nil when they shouldn't) https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/529

- Json representation should contain more information about the view https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/344


#### Other

- Serialization of UIColor object now returns a dictionary/hash. *Note* this is potentially breaking for script relying on parsing the `description` of the UIColor object.

          "red" => 0,
        "alpha" => 0.3,
