### Possible Breaking Changes

The minitest gem version 5.4 was recently released and it changed its base class from `Minitest::Test` to `MiniTest::Unit::TestCase`.[1]  This change is incompatible with the way calabash provided access to the `Test::Unit::Assertions` API.  We have decided not to include `Test::Unit::Assertions` in calabash because nothing in calabash depends on them.  Users who want access to assertions in their tests should follow the instructions on the minitest homepage.[2]

Thanks to @crishoj for helping test the 'minitest' fixes [pull 395](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/pull/395).

### Changes

#### Validate and log UIAChannel communication

A stability improvement which logs UIA actions via the UIAChannel in Calabash server. Should be transparent to most users.

### Fixes

#### Improved Visibility Heuristic

Fixes visibility in cases where a transparent view completely overlaps a non-control (e.g. UILabel).  Previously, calabash would consider this view invisible.

#### Resetting App and Simulator Content & Settings

Fixed a bug in `reset_app_jail`; only the sandbox of the most recent SDK was reset.

* In addition, `reset_app_jail` has been deprecated.  It has been replaced by `reset_app_sandbox`.
* Added `Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.reset_simulator` for simulating touching the iOS Simulator > Reset Simulator Content and Settings... Menu Item.

Thanks to @nemesis for reporting [issue 376](https://github.com/calabash/calabash-ios/issues/376).
