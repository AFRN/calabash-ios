### Changes

#### Validate and log UIAChannel communication

A stability improvement which logs UIA actions via the UIAChannel in Calabash server. Should be transparent to most users.

### Fixes

#### Resetting App and Simulator Content & Settings

Fixed a bug in `reset_app_jail`; only the sandbox of the most recent SDK was reset.

* In addition, `reset_app_jail` has been deprecated.  It has been replaced by `reset_app_sandbox`.
* Added `Calabash::Cucumber::Launcher.reset_simulator` for simulating touching the iOS Simulator > Reset Simulator Content and Settings... Menu Item.
