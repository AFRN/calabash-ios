## 0.10.1 changelog

Thank you to everyone who is reporting bugs for Xcode 6 GM / iOS 8 GM.  We are working hard to resolve these problems and are waiting for Apple to respond to several open bug reports.

### Upcoming Changes

We are exploring deprecating the `calabash_exit` method.  This _might_ break code coverage support.  We think this change will provide a more stable test environment in Xcode 6.

### Xcode 6 GM and iOS 8 GM Support

This release provides _experimental_ support for testing against Xcode 6 Simulators and devices.  There are a number of issues remaining.  Those listed below are the most pressing.

* Cannot launch 7.0.3 simulators from Xcode 6 GM [1]
* UIAApplication preferences API is broken on devices [2][3]
* iOS 8 GM goes into infinite logging loop: ScriptAgent no access to UniqueDeviceID  [4]

We are phasing-in iOS 8 devices and the results look good.
