# This will import the calabash pre-defined steps.
#

# not use pre-defined steps.  Instead, you should write Steps that are specific
# to your application.

# Imports calabash-ios pre-defined steps.
require 'calabash-cucumber/cucumber'

# If you don't want to use the pre-defined steps,
# delete the 'require' above and uncomment the
# requires below.

# Imports calabash-ios without pre-defined steps.
# require 'calabash-cucumber/wait_helpers'
# require 'calabash-cucumber/operations'
